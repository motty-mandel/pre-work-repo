# Study Guide Project for Bootcamp

## Description

The reason I built this study guide was for there to be a place to write down the notes that I accumalated over the course of the prework. Notes for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, to remember complicated steps or just if there was a lot of info to remember. Building this study guide has taught me many different steps and processes to building a wabsite and using Git Hub to help keep everything neat for myself and others working with me.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide is used as a place to write down my notes and to show others what I've learnt building it. If the DevTools console is opened, you can see the JavaScript working it's magic as well as an automated random generator that tells you what topic to choose to learn.
